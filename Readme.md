**Updated instructions**: Engage v1.2.0 includes Timber v1.0 which is installed via composer as the Timber plugin is no longer supported. Not required, but [view Timber Composer installation instructions here](https://timber.github.io/docs/getting-started/switch-to-composer/).

1. After cloning this repo, run these commands from the Engage theme directory: `[local app site directory]/app/public/wp-content/themes/engage`

2. Make sure you are on the latest version of `node` by running `npm doctor`. If anything comes up as not `ok` update your version of `npm` or `node`.

3. Install packages by running

       npm install

4. To open a browser window with live reloading run:

       npm run watch

5. **IMPORTANT** When you are done, to compile your code & minify for the production server be sure to run:

       npm run production
       
## Debug Local App Connection

If you run into any issues with the Engage theme try some of these workarounds to get the site and wp-admin showing up.

- You might have to run `composer require hellonico/timber-dump-extension` to get the [Timber Dump Extension](https://github.com/nlemoine/timber-dump-extension#timber-dump-extension).

- Check the Local App setup:

  - Web server: Apache
  - PHP version above 8.1.0, something like 8.2.10.

- __Switch to WordPress default theme.__

  1. If you cannot access wp-admin rename the theme in your project directory to something like `/engage-0`. This will make WordPress switch to the default theme.
	
  2. Disable all plugins except for Advanced Custom Fields (Engage theme depends on this plugin.)
	
  3. Reactivate the engage theme by renaming it back to `/engage` in the project directory.
  
     _This is an important step, as you will need WordPress to recognize the Engage theme so you can reactivate it on the WordPress dashboard at the Appearance/Themes page._
	
- __Deactivate the Engaging Quiz plugin__

  - This plugin is notorious for causing issues, so keep it deactivated to mitigate any related issues.
